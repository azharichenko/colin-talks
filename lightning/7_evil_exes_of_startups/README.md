# Seven Evil Exes of Startups

At some point career career you're going to work for a start up. You will probably be attracted start up through a variety of tactics meant to sound attractive. That's okay because small companies need to start someplace.They will often times offer you  things that sound great But they are actually only great if you know how best to use them to your advantage.

## Experience

Virtually every opportunity affords experience, from an internship to serving as a CEO, elected by the board of a public company.

Be wary of any opportunity that hooks you with experience in one particular technology or industry. Depth is good and so is breadth.

## Excitement (exciting work)

Similar to promises of experience, highlighty flashy, exciting work using your favorite tools or developing an exciting technology can lure you into something lucrative at the expense of other values.

## Exposure

Exciting work, the stuff of dreams, but… where's the compensation? Getting through the interview process, readying your mind for a big jump from the safety of a secure job or the comfort of academia, only to find out that the company's "market rate" is below average.

> "With XXXX on your résumé, you'll be infinitely employable" - fallacy of the former employer

Exposure is a bit of a meme, especially in the design community, because of the tendency for designers to be able to publicly take credit for their work, which a stereotypically cheap, dishonest customer thinks will lead to more business for the designer.

People die of exposure!

## Exits (equity)

The other side of exposure – promising fame for associating with the company – is the company promising money later in the form of an exit when their equity is finally worth something. You may be offered *incentive stock options* or *restricted stock units*, depending on the ownership structure, public trading status, or a variety of other factors. Ultimately, unless you are a stockholder, you will have no control when it comes time to evaluate IPO paperwork or an acquisition agreement.

You could be promised hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars when the company exits. Until then, as the phrase goes, "toilet paper is worth more than their equity."

## Extremes (fast-paced)

Companies that are new are full of haphazard policies unless the founders bring on intelligent people who have "done this before." Even then, the work and the change of the company's priorities are in a constant state of flux. Someone leaves, someone fills their shoes while still addressing their own work. This "fast-pace" environment allows some to flourish. The constant context switching, the feeling of never knowing what tomorrow will bring, and the all-hands meetings saying that a benefit that was well-treasured is now gone because someone abused it… these are all fast-paced changes.

A steady and changing pace is a good thing. A fast pace a times can be great for business. You as an employee know that you cannot keep up a fast pace forever.

## Exhaustion

This pace, this lack of compensation, this confusion around who owns the company and how much money we're all going to make when it goes public or sells to a FAANG or Asian conglomerate or some private equity company that no one's ever heard of but it owns a quarter of your competitors, this can be exhausting. It's OK to retreat into your text editor, your design tool, your spreadsheets, but it doesn't stop the work from coming. Your 40 hour work-life balance quickly becomes 45 hours. 45 becomes 50 once, twice, and then sustains for a month. A new contract comes in for a feature or whole product that doesn't exist outside of the mind of a guy in product and a guy in engineering who didn't call bullshit when he should have… next thing you know, you've missed your son's first steps or your daughter's award-winning gymnastics performance so you could celebrate an elated customer with your coworkers over a beer at a company happy hour.

The physical effects of stress are awful. Lower back pain. Memory loss outside of work, and sometimes inside it. Your weight goes down from forgetting to eat or it goes up because your only reprieve from communal whipcrack is the 1200-calorie, 400 grams of carbohydrates from the pizza you get every night when working late.

But you did it. You did the thing.

Then you get laid off because the product guy and the engineering guy didn't loop in the sales guy soon enough and no other customer actually wants it.

That's exhaustion. Back to a large corporation? or onto the next set of promises?

## Ex-Google and others (cargo culting)

This last point is especially insiduous. The cargo-cult of the fallacy of the former employer is fervent. "Oh, they worked at XXXX? They can do _anything_ because it's on their résumé." Ultimately, simply citing pedigree is insufficient data for deciding to ally yourself with a company.
