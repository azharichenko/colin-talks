# Mispronunciation Notes

> [I wanted to do a whole talk, probably a lightning talk but maybe a whole full length talk, in which I mispronounce as many technologies as possible and then render a lesson about why people shouldn't freak out about people's mispronunciations](https://twitter.com/colindean/status/1166122212367245312)

## Common Mispronounced Words

* Kubernetes: Cube bear nets, Koo ber nets, Que bear net ees
* Scala: Scal ah
* Java: Dza vah
* nginx: en-jinx, ng-inks (Vietnamese `ng`)

## Missteps

> nginx is pronounced engine-x. engine-x is a cool name. n-jinx is not. if i ever hear you pronounce it n-jinx, i will lose respect for you forever
