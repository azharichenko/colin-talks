Main points
===========

* Code Review is your chance to 
  * critique the code
  * own the code by proxy
  * make the code as if you had written it
  * make the code into something you could maintain

Honest & focused without ego in the way
=======================================

Enables *continuous* evolution of style and methods

Explanation and Response
========================

critique | learning

Code Reviewers are lawyers we want
==================================

Screening and minimizing risk

If Code == Debt
===============

* Team *analyzes* debt
* Team *minimizes* debt
* Team *accepts* debt‚Ä†

‚Ä† including small print

Immediate fix vs backlog
============================

Team as credit raters
=====================

```scala
// XXX   risky business, fix ASAP
// FIXME safe for now, revisit soon
// TODO  low risk + enhancements
```

Group effort, group acceptance
==============================

Commit or patchset = my/their code

- - -

Master = our code

Things we look for
==================

* Complexity of algorithms and loops
* Exception handling
* Exception naming
* Logging sufficiency

Things we look for
==================

* Style conformation
* Variable naming
* Long lines
* Long methods

Things we look for
==================

* Readability
* Extraneous/Unnecessary Comments
* SLOC ùõ•
* Single Purpose 
  * ("and" as a red flag)

But really,
===========

* Does it work?
* Is it tested?

Productive Commenting
=====================

* Attack - "wtf is this crap."
* Statement - "I don't like this."
* Pickyness/pedantry - "Whitespace!"
* Constructive Criticism - "This would perform better if..."

Sometimes meatspace is better
=============================

Learn when to *talk*, not post more

Useful images
