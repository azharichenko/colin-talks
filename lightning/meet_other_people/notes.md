* Coworkers are great
* So are Friends

# One of us

It feels great to belong...

...especially when you didn't feel that previously.

# Good culture

Being friends at work and outside of it with coworkers is important.

# Bad culture

Hating your coworkers means you should probably leave.

# WTSHTF ðŸŒ¬ ðŸ’©

What happens when your coworkers are no longer your coworkers?

What happens when it wasn't a voluntary separation?

# Awkward :turtle:

# New ideas

You can be friends with people at other companies.

You can continue to hang out with your old coworkers regularly without breaking NDAs.

# Monoculture

Isolation leads to monoculture.

Consuming social media and blogs and books are insufficient

# Balance

What your balance?

# Thank you
