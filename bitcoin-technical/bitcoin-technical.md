# Introduction

# Introduction

Digital cryptocurrency.

* Digital - not a physical object (although physical manifestations exist)
* Crypto - secured by cryptography
* Currency - can be used as a medium of exchange, i.e. money.

# Pedantics of Terminology

* Bitcoin = protocol
* bitcoin = money
* BTC = abbr
* XBT = proposed ISO 4217 code

# Who runs it?

We do.

* Not a company. 
* Not a security. 
* Not a product.

# Who develops it?

* Team of ~12 developers
* Gavin Andresen - lead developer
* Satoshi Nakamoto - author, absent

# Two Key Aspects to Technology

* **Mining** - Generation of Bitcoin
* **Transacting** - Exchange of Bitcoin

# Mining Overview

Two purposes:

* Inflate supply, gradually decreasing
* Verify transaction validity

# Mining Algorithm

* Double SHA256 hashing of previous block information
* Continue until result of **sha256(sha256($input))** begins with 12 zeros
* Other things factored in (difficulty, etc.)

# Inflating Supply

* 12 zeros = block
* Block = block reward
* Block reward = BTC

# Continue inflating

* Block found every ~10 minutes
* Sometimes more
* Sometimes less

# Gradually decreasing

January 2009
:   50 BTC per block

November 2012
:   25 BTC per block

August 2016?
:   12.5 BTC per block

# Adjusting for advances

* Difficulty aids consistency
  * Quarters in a boom
  * Quadruples in a bust
* Factored into hashing

# Until it stops

* Continues 32 halvings
* Stop at **21,000,000 BTC**

# When? 

* circa 2140

# Or not

Much sooner?

# Total Bitcoin to Exist

21,000,000.00000000 BTC

# Actually actually

* 2,100,000,000,000,000 units
* 2.1 quadrillion
* 1 unit = **satoshi**

# Comparison

* 10.5 trillion USD in M2: Federal Reserve 
  * M2 = money markets + savings + CDs < $100k PLUS
  * M1 = checking accounts PLUS
  * M0 = currency in circulation
  * M3 = larger deposits, institutional money

# Mapped to USD

* $1 -> $200,000
* Worldwide M3 in circulation = ~$75 trillion (2010)


# Coins in circulation

11.5 million

*(as of 8 August 2013)*

# Also, fees

Block reward + transaction fees

2013: 25 BTC + < .5 BTC
2140: 0 BTC + ??? BTC

# Mining programs

* Automation
* Work distribution, via pooled mining
* Alternative processors (GPU, FPGA, ASIC)
