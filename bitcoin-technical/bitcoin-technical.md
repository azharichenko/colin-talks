Introduction
-----------

Digital cryptocurrency.

* Digital - not a physical object (although physical manifestations exist)
* Crypto - secured by cryptography
* Currency - can be used as a medium of exchange, i.e. money.

Two Key Aspects to Technology
-------------------------------

1. **Mining** - Generation of Bitcoin
2. **Transacting** - Exchange of Bitcoin

Mining Overview
------------------

Two purposes:

1. Inflate supply, gradually decreasing
2. Verify transaction validity

Mining Algorithm
----------------

* Double SHA256 hashing of previous block information
* Continue until result of `sha256(sha256($input))` begins with 12 zeros

Inflating Supply
---------------------

* 12 zeros = block
* Block = block reward
* Block reward = BTC

Gradually decreasing
----------------------------

January 2009 - 50 BTC per block
November 2012 - 25 BTC per block
August 2016? - 12.5 BTC per block

Continues 32 halvings, circa 2140.

Or not
---------

Much sooner?

Also, fees
------------

Block reward + transaction fees

2013: 25 BTC + < .5 BTC
2140: 0 BTC + ??? BTC

Mining programs
-------------------

* Automation
* Work distribution, via pooled mining
* Alternative processors (GPU, FPGA, ASIC)


Coins in circulation
--------------------------

11.5 million

*(as of 8 August 2013)*
