> The first advice I can give you all is, do not pay attention to hype. Every year there is a new programming language, framework, library, pattern, component architecture or paradigm that takes the blogosphere by storm. People get crazy about it. Conferences are given. Books are written. Gartner hype cycles rise and fall. Consultants charge insane amounts of money to teach, deploy or otherwise fuckup the lives of people in this industry. The press will support these horrors and will make you feel guilty if you do not pay attention to them.

His sentiment on LLVM is pretty right on. My extrapolation: Rust and Swift and whatever aren't the new C. LLVM is the new C.
