My big reason for using `make` is that it’s always… there. I think it’s OOTB in most Linux distros and a dep of build-essential in Debian ecosystem and its analogs in other pkg mgrs. It’s OOTB in macOS, at least with Homebrew installations since Homebrew requires xcode CLI tools to be installed, and those include BSD make. All of my Brewfiles include `brew 'make'` to install GNU make but I write portable Makefiles 99% of the time.

I’d probably be using `xmake` or `just` or `ok` otherwise. I used to think Gradle was the be-all-end-all because of its ability to bootstrap itself given only a JVM… but then Apple stopped shipping a modern JVM so the guarantee that someone had an up-to-date JVM went away. The next lowest common denominator: `make`.

This isn’t to say that _all_ dev tasks should be in `make`. I think that’s a good practice but I’d not want to see someone create a bevy of tasks that effectively mirrors all `poetry` commands, for instance. I think the minimum is `make deps check test build` and a `make help` that’s the default and lists all user-intended tasks. So, five tasks. Then, anything longer than a command plus an option that is _regularly_ used goes into the Makefile or the ecosystem-specific build tool (e.g. `npm start` versus `make start-npm-server`… choose the former).
