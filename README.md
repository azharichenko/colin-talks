Talks by Colin Dean
===================

Introduction
------------

This repository is an archive of the various talks I am writing, have written,
and/or have delivered. All talks are original unless noted in the talk or its
directory.

Each talk is in its own directory, and I'll try to remember to tag whenever I've
finalized a talk I delivered.

Contributing
------------

Posting my presentation work online for the world to see has its benefits!

Did you find a bug in example code? Did you find a typographical error? Did you
find a factual error? Please submit a pull request or file an issue.

Colophon
--------

I generally use either [Apple Keynote](https://www.apple.com/mac/keynote/)
or [Marp](https://github.com/yhatt/marp) for my presentations. Sometimes, I'll
use Google Slides if I need something fast or I start it on a mobile device.

For older presentations, I used [Rabbit](http://rabbit-shocker.org/en/), for the most
part. I write the presentations in Markdown using Rabbit's [special
syntax](http://rabbit-shocker.org/en/sample/markdown/rabbit.html).

Principles of Authorship and Delivery
-------------------------------------

* If there is a sentence on a slide, it is the only sentence on the slide.
* No numbered lists greater than 10 items, exceptions for steps or outlines
* No more than one graphic per slide.
* Title slide should identify the speaker, a URL, and relevant contact info.
* End slide should identify the speaker, a URL, and relevant contact info.
* The URL for the talk should be its directory within this repository.
* The contact information should include Twitter handle, event hash tag, and a talk hash tag.
* The color scheme must be readable at no less than 30 ft away.
* The color yellow shall not be seen, except when grouped logically with red and green.
* The slides shall be numbered, but the total number of slides shall be
  optionally displayed.
* Slide text should be no smaller than 40pt if it is the main text on the slide.
  Smaller sizes can be used for footnotes useful for those reviewing the slides
  later.
* Contrast must be visible on crappy projectors.
  * Gray on a black background shall be no darker than 30%.
  * Gray on a white background shall be no lighter than 70%.
  * Avoid using black and gray to distinguish text, instead use capitalization
    or a different font, i.e a serif and a sans-serif font together.
* *Do not* take questions *during* the talk
* Do not take questions *after* the talk, unless there are more than five minutes remaining in the session.
  * Take no more than one question per two minutes available.
  * Do not be afraid to respond with "That's a great question, but I cannot answer it succinctly in the time available."
