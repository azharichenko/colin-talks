# Personal Storage Threat Modeling

Understanding where your data rests, in what state, and how it is secured.

* Walk through
  * Storage devices
    * Encryption key storage, if any
    * Purchase date
    * Warranty expiration date
    * Physical location
    * Online?
    * Internet connected?
    * Protocol for accession?
    * Credentials for accession?
  * Third-party services
    * Credentials required
    * Cost for backup and retrieval
  * Backup source and destination pairs
* Create [DAG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph) for credential retrieval
* Create [deployment diagram](https://plantuml.com/deployment-diagram) for backups

```mermaid
graph LR
  subgraph Internet
    Dropbox{Dropbox}
    S3{AWS S3}
  end
  
  subgraph "My Computer"
    Dbx(Dropbox)
    Comp(Full System Backup)
  end

   Dbx -- HTTPS+Dropbox --> Dropbox
   Comp -- S3+Duplicati --> S3

```

    > In an instant, everything was vaporised. Laptop? Cinders. Phone? Ashes. Home server? A smouldering wreck. Yubikey? A charred chunk of gristle.
    > This presents something of a problem.
    > In order to recover my digital life, I need to be able to log in to things. This means I need to know my usernames (easy) and my passwords (hard). All my passwords are stored in a Password Manager. I can remember the password to that. But logging in to the manager also requires a 2FA code. Which is generated by my phone.
