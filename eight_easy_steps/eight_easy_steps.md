# How to stay paralyzed by fear of abandonment

1. You will face layoffs. You will get fired.
   Prepare for the worst, mentally and financially.
1. You will not want to leave a job because of your loyalty to your
   friends and coworkers.

# How to defer to men in solvable predicaments

1. You will word things so as not to be commital, and this will be
   mistaken for a lack of confidence.
1. You will look to the veterans for guidance and accept their advice
   without understanding their motives or agenda.
1. You will throw your hands up in exasperation and let someone more
   experienced complete the task for you. They could be Obi-Wan—supportive
   and working to teach you—or they could be Yoda, patient but willing to
   give up: "I cannot teach him. The boy has no patience."

1. Your employer will hire people like you who are not like you.
1. Your employer will use you as model, putting you on a pedestal. You

   done about it.

--

# How to mistrust the ones you supposedly love the most

1. Someone will undermine your authority on a matter and you will have to
   spend a lot of time explaining nuances and inaccuracies of what they said.

1. You will scoff at mentoring programs.
1. You will hold in all of your stressors because you think you can
   manage them.

   while in a [Heroic B.S.O.D.](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD).

   outdated corporate policies.

# How to hate women when you're supposed to be a feminist

1. You will be paralyzed by the fear of misspeaking when you
   do not have the capacity to do so.
2. You will tell a manager that a woman is going to leave
   when she finds out that she is paid less than a man with
   less experience who started a year later.
3. You will get bad advice on how to interact with someone
   and spend months rebuilding the trust you initially had.
4. Someone considered to be a visionary will say something extreme, fanning the
   fire of an argument instead of dousing it with wisdom and experience.

# How to play all biased when you're really a hypocrite

   but someone higher up will interfere and leave the unfinished project looking

# [Chorus]

I've been doing research for years
I've been practicing my ass off
I've been training my whole life for this moment, I swear to you
Culminating just to be this well-versed leader before you

# [Chorus]

# How to lie to yourself and thereby to everyone else

1. You will cry at a company luncheon when you realize how much you will miss
   your coworkers, and be unable to say why you are crying because they do not
   yet know that you are leaving. You brush off questions and blame it on
   something else, like a celebrity death or something you read online causing
   tears of laughter, not tears of emotional pain.

--

# How to keep smiling when you're thinking of killing yourself

1. You will talk to power and power will make a decision that is aligned with
   neither your immediate project goals nor your long-term career goals.
1. You will go back to the drawing board again, and again, and again.
1. You will want to quit but cannot find a better opportunity without
   relocating.

# How to know them all too well to avoid going within

--

# How to stay stuck in your life blaming them for everything

1. You will hit ceilings and know that the only way through is painful,
   emotionally and maybe even physically.
1. You will tire of playing games, and realize the only way forward is to play
   a different game on a different court in a different walled garden.

[Chorus: x2]
