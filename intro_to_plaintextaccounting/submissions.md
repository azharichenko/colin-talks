**Length: 60 minutes**

Plain Text Accounting is the practice of maintaining a ledger in a format that values human readability, accountant auditability, and version control. The ledger-like ecosystem enables recording of purchases and transfers and investments, versioning of ledger-files to provide an audit trail, and performing analysis to produce registers, balance sheets, profit and loss statements, track billable time and paid time off, and lots of other reports. In this presentation, you’ll learn some basic accounting principals, ledger tool usage, and why you might choose plain text accounting over Quicken, QuickBooks, Mint.com, or You Need a Budget.

Colin Dean has been using plain text accounting tools for more than four years. He runs the fledgling /r/plaintextaccounting reddit and has contributed to the ledger-like ecosystem.

### Talk title

[Introduction to] Plain Text Accounting with open source tools

### Talk description

Plain Text Accounting is the practice of maintaining a ledger in a
format that values human readability, accountant auditability, and
version control. The ledger-like ecosystem enables recording of
purchases and transfers and investments, versioning of ledger-files
to provide an audit trail, and performing analysis to produce
registers, balance sheets, profit and loss statements, track
billable time and paid time off, and lots of other reports. In this
presentation, you’ll learn some basic accounting principals, ledger
tool usage, and why you might choose plain text accounting over
Quicken, QuickBooks, Mint.com, or You Need a Budget. 

Colin Dean has
been using plain text accounting tools for more than four years. He
runs the fledgling /r/plaintextaccounting reddit and has
contributed to the ledger-like ecosystem.

### How would this presentation be interesting to the open source community?

Open source developers are often professional software engineers
who have high incomes. Far too often, these engineers mismanage
their personal finances and squander the assets at their disposal.
This talk introduces personal finance accounting in general and
moves into teaching how to use the open source plain text
accounting ecosystem to manage one's money.
