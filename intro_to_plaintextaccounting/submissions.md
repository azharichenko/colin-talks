**Length: 60 minutes**

Plain Text Accounting is the practice of maintaining a ledger in a format that values human readability, accountant auditability, and version control. The ledger-like ecosystem enables recording of purchases and transfers and investments, versioning of ledger-files to provide an audit trail, and performing analysis to produce registers, balance sheets, profit and loss statements, track billable time and paid time off, and lots of other reports. In this presentation, you’ll learn some basic accounting principals, ledger tool usage, and why you might choose plain text accounting over Quicken, QuickBooks, Mint.com, or You Need a Budget.

Colin Dean has been using plain text accounting tools for more than four years. He runs the fledgling /r/plaintextaccounting reddit and has contributed to the ledger-like ecosystem.

### Talk title

[Introduction to] Plain Text Accounting with open source tools

### Talk description

Plain Text Accounting is the practice of maintaining a ledger in a
format that values human readability, accountant auditability, and
version control. The ledger-like ecosystem enables recording of
purchases and transfers and investments, versioning of ledger-files
to provide an audit trail, and performing analysis to produce
registers, balance sheets, profit and loss statements, track
billable time and paid time off, and lots of other reports. In this
presentation, you’ll learn some basic accounting principals, ledger
tool usage, and why you might choose plain text accounting over
Quicken, QuickBooks, Mint.com, or You Need a Budget. 

Colin Dean has
been using plain text accounting tools for more than four years. He
runs the fledgling /r/plaintextaccounting reddit and has
contributed to the ledger-like ecosystem.

### How would this presentation be interesting to the open source community?

Open source developers are often professional software engineers
who have high incomes. Far too often, these engineers mismanage
their personal finances and squander the assets at their disposal.
This talk introduces personal finance accounting in general and
moves into teaching how to use the open source plain text
accounting ecosystem to manage one's money.

**Length: 3 hr workshop**, see [Workshop](workshop.md) for more details

### Description

This workshop aims to teach accounting basics and teach how to use the core tools of the Plain Text Accounting ecosystem in a workflow familiar to software developers who prefer command line tools, build systems, and easily-transported report formats.

#### What is Plain Text Accounting?

Plain Text Accounting is the practice of maintaining a ledger in a format that values human readability, accountant auditability, and version control. The ledger-like ecosystem enables recording of purchases and transfers and investments, versioning of ledger-files to provide an audit trail, and performing analysis to produce registers, balance sheets, profit and loss statements, track billable time and paid time off, and lots of other reports.

#### Why should you attend?

Developers throughout the world are often highly-compensated professionals. By carefully capturing and documenting the flow of one's money, these professionals can avoid mismanaging their personal finances and squandering the assets at their disposal, preserving more funds for important things like debt repayment, retirement investment, vacations, and charitable contributions. This talk introduces personal finance accounting in general and moves into teaching how to use the open source plain text accounting ecosystem to manage one's money.

### Primarily for

Developers, Tester/test leads, Architects, Security professionals, Product developers, Managers, Others

### Participant requirements

They should bring a laptop but it's not 100% necessary as long as at least half of the group has a laptop with them.

### Goal

> How would you describe your goal for attendees of this workshop? What do you want them to walk away with, and how do you see this adding value to their coding journey?

Far too often, developers mismanage their personal finances and squander the assets at their disposal. This talk introduces personal finance accounting in general and moves into teaching how to use the open source plain text accounting ecosystem to manage one's money. They'll walk away with a fun, creative way to effectively collect their transaction data iteratively and analyze it using freely available tools combined with some of their own code.

### What will attendees make?
> It's important that attendees walk away with something tangible. What will attendees make during your workshop? If they're following an existing tutorial, please include a link to that tutorial. Otherwise, please submit in as much detail as possible what steps attendees will go through to complete this project.

Attendees will walk away with a basic ledger transaction log, modeled on their own account statement or an example one.

Steps in the workshop:

* how to track daily transactions as well as investments, from brokerage accounts to cryptocurrencies
    * Write Ledger transactions by hand
    * Use a tool that expedites manual entry
* how to automate some entry of data
    * exporting data from a bank in CSV or QFX format
    * running a conversion tool
    * customizing a conversion tool plugin to convert inevitable strange CSV
* how to analyze and visualize data
    * how to build informative reports with HTML, SVG, PDFs, and more
    * how to use an existing visualization suite that requires post-processing the Ledger log
* how to securely backup your financial data stored as plain text
    * Using private git repos
    * Automating some entry using Git hosting sites' repo hooks

### Introduction to Topic
> Having some background info on the workshop topic before getting started on a project is important. What background info do you plan to present? Think of this as a short 5-10 min talk to give people context before diving in. Please provide as much detail as possible.

* basic generally-accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and double-entry accounting,
* ledger command line tool usage,
* alternatives to and similar programs that complement ledger
* why you might choose Plain Text Accounting over other tools such as Quicken, QuickBooks, Mint.com, or You Need a Budget

### Fit
> Why are you the right person to conduct this workshop? This is less about expertise (which is not a requirement), and more about the relationship between the topic and the workshop conductor, and finding a good fit. Feel free to include your passion, past experience, previous roles, etc.

## Pittsburgh Techfest 2020

### Elevator Pitch

Years ago, I needed a way to track my time at work. I found a neat Ledger accounting program that does that and so much more. I relearned double-entry bookkeeping and now use this to run books for myself and two other organizations. I'll talk about the freedom of plain text and how to automate much.
