# Other Reports

There are some other reports and command functions that are useful but outside
the scope of this workshop.

## Special balance reports

* `cleared` : Shows a special `balance` view that more visibly shows balances
              when there are transactions that have not yet cleared, e.g. a
              check is in the mail.
* `equity`: Prints current account balances as a single transaction.
            Useful for summarizing previous years as an opening balances
            transaction on a fresh ledger.


## Keeping a Tidy Transaction Log

* `print` : Prints all transactions nicely formatted with the minimal text
            necessary to represent the transaction. Useful for sorting
            transactions that were entered out of order.

## Exporting for Other Programs


While the Plain Text Ecosystem has a lot of useful tools,
a few other commands facilitate interacting with other programs.

* `csv` : Outputs transactions in CSV format.
* `xml` : Outputs transactions in XML format.
