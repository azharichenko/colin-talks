# Viewing in Fava

[Fava](https://beancount.github.io/fava/) is the best visualization tool for the Plaintext Accounting ecosystem. Unfortunately, it requires input in a specific variant of Ledger format called Beancount, a Ledger-like that uses a more explicit syntax. Fortunately, we can convert Ledger to Beancount and be able to use Fava fully.

## Converting to Beancount

Having installed `ledger2beancount` using the instructions in @sec:install_ledger2beancount, you can run it after making your own configuration file.

    cp ledger2beancount.yml myl2b.yml
    # edit myl2b.yml
    bin/ledger2beancount --config myl2b.yml my.ledger > my.beancount

## Running Fava

This one's simple!

    fava my.beancount

Fava will run a webserver accessible via [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). You can explore around the Fava interface, notably two views:

1. Income Statement -> Net Profit. This is a cashflow analysis, Income minus Expenses.
2. Balance Sheet -> Net Worth. This is a net worth analysis, Assets minus Liabilities.

You may see some _errors_ on the left sidebar. ledger2beancount can't handle 100% of all things, so sometimes Beancount still works while silently failing. For example, balance assertions can be ambiguous, so ledger2beancount converts in a way that Beancount will continue to work but not enforce the assertions. It's OK, because any assertions you've made still guard your record in your original transaction log.
