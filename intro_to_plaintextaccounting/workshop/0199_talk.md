# Introduction to Accounting and Ledger {#sec:intro_talk}

This workshop is paired with the presentation "Plain Text Accounting with the
Ledger Ecosystem".

If you're working on this workshop as a part of a conference, there's a pretty good chance that you've just listened to this presentation live!
Thanks for listening, and now you'll get a great chance to interact with the examples provided in that presentation.

That said, if you've not already done so, please consume the presentation in some way before proceeding in order to learn:

* Double-entry accounting basics
* Account naming conventions
* Reporting types
* Terminology of `ledger` and the rest of the Plain Text Accounting ecosystem
* The "whys" of the Plain Text Accounting ecosystem
