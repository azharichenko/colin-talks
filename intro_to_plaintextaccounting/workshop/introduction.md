# Command-line finances using the Plain Text Accounting ecosystem

This workshop aims to teach accounting basics and teach how to use the core tools of the Plain Text Accounting ecosystem in a workflow familiar to software developers who prefer command line tools, build systems, and easily-transported report formats.

## What is Plain Text Accounting?

Plain Text Accounting is the practice of maintaining a ledger in a format that values human readability, accountant auditability, and version control. The ledger-like ecosystem enables recording of purchases and transfers and investments, versioning of ledger-files to provide an audit trail, and performing analysis to produce registers, balance sheets, profit and loss statements, track billable time and paid time off, and lots of other reports.
