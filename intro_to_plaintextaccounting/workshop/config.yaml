  thanks: |
    Thank you to John Wiegley, author of Ledger, for starting a revolution
    freeing personal and business finances from the walled garden of
    proprietary software.

    Thank you to Simon Michael, author of hledger and maintainer of
    plaintextaccounting.org, for turning a single tool into an ecosystem
    with a standard.

    Thank you to my parents, who involved me in financial decisions from
    and early age, teaching me how to save money and keep track of my money
    even when theirs was exceptionally tight.

    And lastly, thank you to you who are seeking to improve how you live your
    life. May your thirst for knowledge be quenched by this workshop, and I
    hope that you will contribute back to the Plaintext Accounting ecosystem
    by sharing your knowledge as I have shared mine.
