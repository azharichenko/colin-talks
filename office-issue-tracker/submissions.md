# Submissions of the Office Issue Tracker talk

## Pittsburgh TechFest 2019

### Title

Tracking physical space issues with GitHub

### Abstract

Why not track problems and wishes in the same way we track bugs and feature requests? I’ve done this now for three workplaces and am soon introducing this methodology to a fourth. Through this method, office denizens’ happiness and pride will increase and the space will be safer and more useful.

### Description

Engineers work in physical spaces that have issues and opportunities for improvement, just like the software they are creating. Why not track problems and wishes in the same way we track bugs and feature requests?

Using GitHub and its issue tracker for signaling when lightbulbs need to be changed, when paper towels are out, when a projector is broken, or when you deserve a new espresso machine is the natural next step in your team’s use of GitHub.

I’ve done this now for three workplaces with varying degrees of success and am soon introducing this methodology to a fourth. I’ll share collaboration tips to ease non-technical office managers into the GitHub workflow and how to make some simple diagrams to help minimize curation work.

Through this method, office denizens’ happiness and pride will increase and the office will be safer and more useful.

### Notes for Reviewers

I implemented this with great success at IBM Watson in Pittsburgh. We’ve used this same method at Code & Supply, with spikes of activity and attention. I wanted to set it up for another employer but could not get executive buy-in – “engineers shouldn’t have to care about their workspace” then they fired the remote office manager – so it faltered and engineers ended up doing things anyway. I’ll soon try with my current employer as of 2019 and I anticipate the result being more like IBM since the team uses its office much more like IBM does and there are some former IBMers working with me now!

This talk will be an expansion and formalization of my blog post [Using Github to track issues with physical space](https://medium.com/@colindean/using-github-to-track-issues-with-physical-space-b2efe37b96ad). The methodology is rather easy and relies heavily on:

* effective use of issue labels,
* continuous integration for workflow diagram updates and label usage enforcement, and
* regular meetings with someone who has the power to drive the changes and be a conduit to the building manager or landlord.

I’ll elaborate more with some suggested automation that could be used to make the experience even easier.

GitHub users, especially Enterprise users, need to think creatively how to reuse the tools they have at their disposal. This non-obvious use could spur some other creative uses for Github.

### Additional info

_(personal stuff)_

I think people are interested in hearing stories of unconventional uses of tooling and how a group of engineers banded together to reduce frustration and restore pride in our physical workplace at a time when we felt abandoned.

Tracking physical space with GitHub

### Abstract

Engineers work in physical spaces that have issues and opportunities for improvement, just like the software they are creating. Why not track problems and wishes in the same way we track bugs and feature requests?

Using GitHub and its issue tracker for signaling when lightbulbs need to be changed, when paper towels are out, when a projector is broken, or when you deserve a new espresso machine is the natural next step in your team's use of GitHub.

I've done this now for two workspaces and am soon introducing this methodology to a third. I'll share collaboration tips to ease non-technical office managers into the GitHub workflow and how to make some simple diagrams to help minimize curation work.

Through this method, office denizens' happiness and pride will increase and the space will be safer and more useful.

### Pitch

GitHub is pretty great for the source code for programs, books, and more. Using it to track office issues instead of antiquated general ticketing systems like RT keeps Engineers in their workflow and reduces the number of systems in use.

GitHub users, especially Enterprise users, need to think creatively how to reuse the tools they have at their disposal. This non-obvious use could spur some other creative uses for Github.

I've done this now for two workspaces (IBM Watson and Code & Supply in Pittsburgh) and am soon introducing this methodology to a third (Arcadia Healthcare Solutions in Pittsburgh).
