# Your proposal for Rust Belt Rust 2016

## Talk Information

### Talk Title

Code review is an architectural necessity

### Talk Abstract (what will go on the website to promote your talk)

There's a wealth of material on code review from a code quality standpoint, tracking a host of metrics and generating enough Big Data to employ a small army of analysts at some companies, I'm sure. But introducing code review at the architecture stage seems to be rarely done, maybe even sufficiently rare to qualify as novel.

In this presentation, I intend to reintroduce code review and the problems it solves. I'll focus on some quality attributes valued by a team that conscientiously conducts code reviews, and that code review enables, but not guarantees, these attributes in the team's systems' architecture: maintainability, compliance, and security, and some attributes that, from my point of view, are components of these.

I posit based on my own meandering experience across several projects that these quality attributes are enabled through code review and saved from being a poorly timed afterthought or patch onto an architecture. To do so, I'll analogize lawyers, debt collectors, credit ratings, journalism, and more.

### Notes for reviewers (additional info about what you might cover, any logistical needs you might have)

I have a bit of background in journalism, and my teammates have said that it gives me a perspective and openness to code review that many engineers don't have.

I'm low maintenance logistically.

### What format would work best for this talk?

30 minute talk

### Who's your ideal audience?

This talk as proposed is probably geared more toward architects, but started as a talk aimed squarely at engineers. Some of the analogies are the result of a group discussion among engineers. The "quality attributes" section is something that might seem a little buzzwordy, but those who have heard me talk about this have commented that it's largely a vocabulary extracted from common sense things.

### Why are you excited to talk about this?

I've been doing code reviews for most of my professional career and have experienced the good and bad sides of it, as well as the bad sides of not having it. I'm surprised when I hear that companies don't do it! Moreover, I was so accustomed to having my work critiqued that not having that feels really weird. I wish to share my experience and insight so that others can learn from the mistakes I've observed with the hopes that the Rust community can establish code review as a standard practice for all of its projects, open or proprietary.

## Balancing Information

### Have you presented on this topic at other events? If so, where and when?

I will present on this topic May 2, 2016 at SATURN 2016. I've led discussions on it internally at work.

### What is your previous speaking experience? We'd like to have a good mix of new and experienced speakers.

While I've organized several developer conferences and similar events for nearly 10 years, I've only recently sought to speak. If accepted, this would be my second acceptance. I have spoken at local meetups, though infrequently.

### Are you from the Rust Belt? We'd love to have some speakers from the region as well as people from outside it!

Yes. Born and raised.

## Making Life Easier

### Bio for the website, about a paragraph

Colin Dean wears many hats. While not engineering software for IBM Watson, he organizes conferences such as Abstractions, devopsdays Pittsburgh, and Steel City Ruby, spreads connectivity in Pittsburgh via Meta Mesh Wireless Communities, and even occasionally makes appearances at dog shows with Glade Mill Sporting & Hound.
