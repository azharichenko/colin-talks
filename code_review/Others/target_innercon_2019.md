Code Review is not a new concept, but a specific term for an older concept -- Peer Review -- that focuses the review process on the code under examination instead of the person who submitted it. While Code Review is common in open source projects, organizations developing in private often employ inefficient, frustrating, or virtually non-existent review processes. This talk looks at Code Review from an architect's viewpoint, arguing that Code Review is an essential component in a product's architectural plan because of the quality attributes it may provide. It also covers tips and sets expectations for what Code Review can and cannot solve.
