# Code Review is an Architectural Necessity

## Abstract

Code Review is not a new concept, but a specific term for an older concept -- Peer Review -- that focuses the review process on the code under examination instead of the person who submitted it. While Code Review is common in open source projects, organizations developing in private often employ inefficient, frustrating, or virtually non-existent review processes. This talk looks at Code Review from an architect's viewpoint, arguing that Code Review is an essential component in a product's architectural plan because of the quality attributes it may provide. It also covers tips and sets expectations for what Code Review can and cannot solve.

## Details

The audience will:

* Appreciate that many other professions are subject to rigorous review processes and accept that software must, too
* Understand the difference between Code Review and Peer Review
* Value tools that enable Code Review, such as Github's pull request feature
* Understand the problems that Code Review solves: mental model sync and tribal knowledge development
* Understand a handful of "-ility" quality attributes that Code Review delivers
* Learn some tips for effective reviews and review workflows
* Internalize the limitations of code review, such as not solving political problems

## Pitch
I delivered a very similar talk to SATURN and it was very well-received. Several veterans of software architecture complimented me on my content and one said that I inspired him to include Code Review as an architectural step in his next project, instead of relying on his developers to whimsically do it.

I am the tech lead for a component of a key Watson product: I was individually responsible for approximately 5% of Watson group revenue in 2015 (how we arrived at that is a little convoluted, ask me over beer #theydidthemath). My team does this with a very low defect rate and every line of code that goes into our project undergoes our lightweight yet thorough review process.
