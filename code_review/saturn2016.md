Code review is an architectural necessity
=========================================

SATURN 2016

Architecture Methods and Design Patterns track

30 minute experience report

Abstract
--------
There's a wealth of material on code review from a code quality standpoint, tracking a host of metrics and generating enough Big Data to employ a small army of analysts at some companies, I'm sure. But introducing code review at the architecture stage seems to be rarely done, maybe even sufficiently rare to qualify as novel. In this presentation, I intend to focus on some quality attributes valued by a team that conscientiously conducts code reviews, and that code review enables, but not guarantees, these attributes in the team's systems' architecture: accountablility, accuracy, auditability, debugability, efficiency, evolvability, failure transparency, inspectability, learnability, maintainability, manageability, modularity, predicability, repeatability, safety, serviceability, simplicity, standards compliance, testability, traceability, and understandability. I posit based on my own meandering experience across several projects, open and proprietary, that these quality attributes are enabled through code review and saved from being a poorly timed afterthought or patch onto an architecture. To do so, I'll analogize lawyers, debt collectors, credit ratings,

Session mechanics
-----------------
A very rough outline is available here: https://github.com/colindean/talks/blob/master/code_review/code_reviews.md

This outline as written is geared more toward convincing a group of people to employ code review in their workflow. My end goal is to cast code review in the list of an architectural necessity because of the quality attributes it values and enables, if the code review is thorough and conscientious. I've considering doing this particular talk using Takahashi Method, although I'm not committed to it.

Target audience
---------------
Folks who haven't tried code review or who do it but hate it and are willing to change their views.

Learning Outcomes
-----------------
I want attendees to walk away with a newfound appreciation for code review. They should be able to integrate code review not as merely an engineering process, but as a key part of an application's architecture.
