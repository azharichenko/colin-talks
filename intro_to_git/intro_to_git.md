# GitHub Public vs GitHub Enterprise

* GHE lags behind public
* Most features are the same
* Sometimes need to specify which when referencing

# Workflow

0. Clone
1. Branch
2. Edit
3. Test
4. Commit
5. Push
6. Pull Request
7. Merge
8. Pull

### Git + GitHub Workflow Diagram

```{.graphviz caption="Git+GitHub workflow"}
digraph git_github_workflow {
  rankdir=LR;
  size="9,9"

  graph [fontname = "helvetica"];
  node [fontname = "helvetica"];
  edge [fontname = "helvetica"];

  node [shape = point ]; start
  node [shape = octagon, label = "Clean\nClone"]; clean_local_repo
  node [shape = doubleoctagon, label = "Working\nCopy"]; working_copy
  node [shape = tripleoctagon, label = "Dirty\nWorking\nCopy"]; dirty_working
  node [shape = square, label = "Working\nBranch"]; working_branch
  node [shape = circle, label = "Remote\nBranch"]; pushed
  node [share = circle, label = "PR'd"]; open_pr
  node [share = circle, label = "Merged"]; merged

  start -> clean_local_repo [ label = "Clone" ];
  clean_local_repo -> working_copy [ label = "Branch" ];
  working_copy -> dirty_working [ label = "Edit" ];
  dirty_working -> dirty_working [ label = "Test & Refactor" ];
  dirty_working -> working_branch [ label = "Commit" ];
  working_branch -> pushed [ label = "Push" ];
  pushed -> open_pr [ label = "Pull Request" ];
  open_pr -> merged [ label = "Merge" ];
  merged -> clean_local_repo [ label = "Pull" ];
}
```

----

# Clone

    git clone git@git.example.com:colindean/talks.git
    git clone https://git.example.com/colindean/talks.git

_Use SSH whenever possible._

----

# Branch

    git switch -c colindean_87_fixes-stuff

_Many teams have branch naming conventions._

----

# Edit & Test

Do the thing! Write the tests!

----

# Commit

    git add newfile.txt
    git commit -av

_Write browsable summaries and detailed body text._

----

# Commit summaries

## Bad üö´

"Updates image URL"

## Good ‚ô•Ô∏è

"Fixes broken image because of outdated URL"

----

# Push

    git push -u origin HEAD
    git push # subsequent pushes

Push to store your work, even if you don't open a‚Ä¶

----

# Pull Request

    hub pull-request

or create it on GitHub.

CI/CD will test your code and report.

----

# Code Review

Follow your team's best practices.

Use GitHub's guide.

Watch conference talks from:

* Adrienne Tacke
* Aaron Goldsmith
* Amy Gebhardt
* Colin Dean

# Best Practices

----

# Ask for help

# Do not use the force

Bad:

    git push --force

Lease, don't own:

    git push --force-with-lease
