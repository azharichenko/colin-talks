Meta Mesh Wireless Communities

::: notes
I've been involved in this organization since its
humble beginnings as a bunch of kids trying to
build a city-wide mesh network. In 2020, we're
actually kinda getting there as we pivot to being
a non-profit Wireless ISP.

# Task

Write a high-level overview about our product for

* executive review
* senior director briefing
* director deep-dive

---

Multiple audiences meant:

1. Deep content coverage
2. Summaries
3. Navigability

---

## A big change

---

<i style="font-size: 5em" class="fas fa-pause"></i>

---

Our product development was _paused_,
so we needed to document _everything_.

It may not be our team that continues
development.

---

## Audience and depth expansion

Detailed white paper for

* executive review
* senior director briefing
* director deep-dive
* **data scientists and engineers**

---

# Dramatis Personae

A team of seven colocateed data scientists and engineers

---

Lots of **engineering** detail: architecture, implementation

Lots of **mathematical** detail: equations, proofs

---

# Real need

A content-focused, scientific document authoring workflow
for Data Scientists and Engineers alike

---

# Thinking architecturally

::: notes
It's a good practice to figure out the things
that you value about a system before you start
building it.
:::

---

## Primary Values

* Reviewable content: prose and diagrams
* Content-focused with minimal markup
* Minimize structural exceptions with standardized styling and typesetting

---

## Secondary Values

* Accomodate some preferences for LaTeX over simpler formats (Markdown)
* Easy to use: one command to generate output
* Automation: artifact built from versioned, single master copy

---

**Treat documentation like source code.**

---

## Avoid at all costs

* Binary files
* Passing around a file
* Manual copy-paste to merge changes
* Difficult exports from wiki format
* Forcing everyone to (re)learn LaTeX

# Solution

---

# `pandoc` + `git` + GitHub + Drone CI

---

## What this gets us

* Write in a simple text format
* Distribute changes and settle conflicts
* Review and suggest changes
* Push button to receive PDF, archived forever

---

## Biggest benefit?

LaTeX typesetting without ~~suffering~~ writing LaTeX

---

or, LaTeX when you _need it_

---

# `pandoc`, briefly

"A universal document converter"

---

## `pandoc`, less briefly

* 1.0 in 2008, 2.0 in 2017, 2.9.x in 2019
* Open source, GPL-2.0-or-later
* Written in Haskell with a Lua scripting engine
* 33 input formats, dozens of output formats

---

# `pandoc` basics

---

## Install

```shell
brew  install pandoc  # macOS with Homebrew
apt   install pandoc  # Debian/Ubuntu/Pop_OS
scoop install pandoc  # Windows with Scoop
crew  install pandoc  # Chrome OS with chromebrew
```

::: notes

pandoc is available in virtually every package manager
and there are downloadable installers available on pandoc.org

:::

---

## Invocation

```shell
pandoc document.md -o document.pdf
```

::: notes

pandoc attempts to figure out the input and output
formats based on the filenames, but oftentimes it's
better to be explicit.

:::

---

![Running on this presentation](example_pdf.png)

::: notes

This is an example output of running pandoc
on an early version of these slides,
which is written in Markdown and uses pandoc
to produce the code which comprises this presentation!

::::

---

## Real Invocation

```shell
pandoc \
  01_intro.md 02_problem.md 03_diagnosis.md \
  04_remedy.md 05_summary.md \
  --output documentation.pdf \
  --filter pandoc-crossref \
  --filter pandoc-citeproc \
  --lua-filter .filters/glossary/pandoc-gls.lua \
  --pdf-engine xelatex \
  --top-level-division=chapter \
  --number-sections \
  --toc --toc-depth=3 \
  -M lof -M lot \
  --bibliography=bibliography.bib \
  â€¦
```

::: notes
Break down chapters and sections into separate files. Pandoc concatenates input.

Note the use of filters, the choice of PDF engine
that enables XeLaTeX in order to use Unicode and some other implementation-specific features.

Note the choices about table of contents, section numbering, lists of figures and tables, and bibliography.

## This presentation is written in Markdown

and converted to a Reveal.js presentation:

```makefile
PRESENTATION = document_workflow
MARKDOWN = $(PRESENTATION).md
HTML = $(PRESENTATION).html
DEPS_DIR = deps
all: $(HTML)

%.html: %.md
  pandoc \
    --to=revealjs --standalone \
    $< --output=$@ \
    -M revealjs-url=$(DEPS_DIR)/reveal.js/reveal.js-3.9.2
```
::: notes
Reveal and Powerpoint are supported first-class for output

## Build system vs. a script

* Make
* Gradle

::: notes
Any sufficiently advanced build script eventually reimplements Make.
:::

---

## Common plugins

|Plugin|Purpose|
|------|-------|
|`pandoc-citeproc`|Processes citations, enables BibTeX use|
|`pandoc-crossref`|Enables cross-referencing for figures, equations, sections, etc.|
|`code-includes`  |Includes code from files instead of embedding|

::: notes
We've used citeproc and crossref extensively.
:::

---

## More plugins

Plugins written in Haskell, Lua, Python, and more

Loads more: https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/wiki/Pandoc-Filters

::: notes
Strongly recommend using Lua, which doesn't require
installing or compiling anything additional.
:::

## Diagrams

External or embedded

```

::: notes

Images can be in a variety of formats. I tend to convert
everything to PDF and include the PDF version in the Markdown
because I know that PDF will look right versus SVG, because
SVG output rarely converts fonts to paths.

# Our workflow

::: notes
Next, I'll tell you about how my team used this powerful tool to create a workflow that enabled us to collaborate without having to pass around a file.
:::
---

## Four primary tools

|Tool|Utility|
|----|-------|
|`pandoc`|Write in a simple text format, Markdown|
|`git`   |Distribute changes and settle conflicts|
|GitHub  |Review and suggest changes, treat docs as code|
|Drone CI|Push button to receive PDF, archived forever|

---

### Flow of data

```{.graphviz caption="Git+GitHub workflow"}
digraph document_workflow {
  rankdir=LR;
  size="9,9"

  graph [fontname = "helvetica"];
  node [fontname = "helvetica"];
  edge [fontname = "helvetica"];

  node [label="Working Copy"]; edit
  node [label="pandoc"]; local_render
  node [label="Commited Work"]; commit
  node [label="GitHub"]; github
  node [label="CI"]; ci
  node [label="pandoc in Docker"]; remote_render

  github -> edit [ label = "Clone" ]
  edit -> edit [ label = "Write" ]
  edit -> local_render [label="Compile"]
  local_render -> edit [label="Fix"]
  edit -> commit [label="Commit"]
  commit -> edit [label="Refactor"]
  commit -> github [label="Push"]
  github -> ci [label="Check"]
  ci -> github [label="Validate"]
  ci -> remote_render [label="Compile"]
  remote_render -> github [label="Save Build Artifacts"]
  remote_render -> github [label="Notify of Build Errors"]

}
```

---

### Authoring

* Use a Markdown-specific text editor with preview
  * [PanWriter](https://github.com/mb21/panwriter), [MacDown](https://github.com/MacDownApp/macdown)
  * `vim` + `entr` + PDF viewer
* Writing one sentence per line makes review suggestions easier.

---

### Managing content

* One chapter per file - enables extraction
* Transforms necessitate a build directory

::: notes

When you limit relevant content to a single file,
you can deftly extract a single chapter or a few
into a single PDF. This is great for a summary PDF
or for testing only one file in a large document.

Our final paper, which was approximately forty five
pages, takes around 12 seconds to compile on my 2019
MacBook Pro. Compiling with only one section takes about
two seconds.

:::

---

### Committing

Use `git` commits to tell a story about the changes.

---

### Reviewing

#### Pull Requests

* Assign reviewers automatically with `CODEOWNERS`
* Choose submitter-merge or reviewer-merge

---

#### Continuous Integration

Block PR merging with CI system automation.

* Ensure valid markup and view changes compiled
* Run `proselint` or a grammar/spelling tool

::: notes

Every time I've not set up CI on a repo using this template,
someone has managed to merge to master something that breaks
the PDF build and it's been difficult to track down. I know
what to look for now â€“ XeLaTeX doesn't like greek letters
inside formatting inside equations, apparently a no longer
necessary practice.

# Pain Points

---

## Pain getting started

* Dependency installation
* Learning Pandoc's flavor of Markdown
* "Why can't I just use LaTeX?"
* Converting from Word or LaTeX loses cross-referencesËš

<small><em>Ëšas of Pandoc 2.9.x</em></small>

---

## Productivity Pain points

* Incomplete WYSIWYG
* Bugs in workflow, sole developer stakeholder
* Equation writing workflow disjointed
  * Editor with TeX equations support
  * Separate renderer (LaTeXiT, MathJax.com)
  * Just render it

---

## Accomodating objections

* I want to use X
  * "But I want to use LaTeX"
    * only if you'll own that file!
  * "But I want to write my section in X and export it to Pandoc Markdown"
    * only if you can effect changes suggested in the PR

---

## Greatest risk of additional transformation tools?

---

### Overwriting.

Changes made to a file in the repo being overwritten by the output of an external tool's cost us _a lot_ of time.
