# Task

Write a white paper about our product for

* executive review
* senior director briefing
* director deep-dive

Multiple audiences meant:

1. Deep content coverage
2. Summaries
3. Navigability

## A big change

<i class="fas fa-pause"></i>

Our product development was _paused_,
so we needed to document _everything_.

It may not be our team that continues
development.

# Dramatis Personae

A team of seven colocateed data scientists and engineers

---

Lots of **engineering** detail: architecture, implementation

Lots of **mathematical** detail: equations, proofs

---

# Real need

A content-focused, scientific document authoring workflow
for Data Scientists and Engineers alike
