# Strangeloop 2023

:joy: My first Strangeloop!

:cry: Last Strangeloop ever

---

## St. Louis

* 90Â°F in September was unexpected
* Gateway Arch was neat and worth the wait
* Pretty, flat city

---

## Keynote: Taylor Poindexter and Scott Hanselman

* it's ok to make money
* set long-term goals and short-term plans but embrace changes of plan or failure
* give yourself grace

---

## Playing with Engineering
_AnnMarie Thomas_

* Worked with OKGO on using their music videos to teach physics
* play is about process, not outcomes
* play involves freedom of choice
* play is social and joyful

## Building Strong and Sustainable Open Source Projects: Lessons from an Epic Road Trip
_Lawrence Gray_

* open governance and transparency
* inclusivity
* prevent burnout
* engage community

---

## Programming Distributed Systems
_Mae Milano_

* distributed systems are hard
* language compiler can identify weak and strong references, and something in between
* the speed of light is too slow, only 4 inches per clock cycle right now!
* build languages that understand how to handle references better to build better-distributed systems

---

## IPVM: Seamless Services for an Open World
_Brooklyn Zelenka_

* What we have now was designed for the 90s
* the speed of light is too slow, limits responsivity, and increases latency
* we have to move toward a world where there's not a single, centralized place for things
* preserve user agency 
* checkpoints with receipts to speed up computation across distributed workers
* verifiable computation

## Experimentation: putting research papers into prod
_Leemay Nassery_

* a/v testing is hard
* interleaving - control and treatment 
* overlapping - consider interaction effects, must embrace simultaneous tests as tests scale

---

## An approach to computing and sustainability inspired from permaculture
_Devine Lu Linvega_

* The advantages of simple tools
* that which cannot be repaired is already broken
* a spaceship is limited by fuel, water, and food if humans are on it
* I live in a boat; it's basically a spaceship because it has limited capacity for power and water and food
* it's crazy to expect people to be online and on the fastest computer all of the time
* much of the history of computation is forgotten
* they didn't die because they were bad; they died because of natural selection

## Can a Programming Language Reason About Systems?
_Marianne Bellotti_			

* reasoning about systems
* how do people build mental models
* formal methods: simulation (define inputs and operation), checking (define operation & outputs, verify), symbolic execution (suggestion operation from input and output)

## A Long Strange Loop
_Alex Miller_

* Oct 22 2009 first conf
* Uncle spent his whole life connecting people through their passions
* name came from Doug Hofstader novel
* "my Twitter feed came and hung out"
* More than 5000 cfp subs in 13 years 
* every talk is a favorite talk
* speaker: match expectations set in submission 
* "I had to buy aerialist insurance"
* moved 2020 hotel contract to 2023
* if you open ticket sales earlier, you probably sell more tickets
