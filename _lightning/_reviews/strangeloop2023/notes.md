_Lawrence Gray_

* open governance and transparency
* inclusivity
* prevent burnout
* engage community

## Programming Distributed Systems
_Mae Milano_

* distributed systems are hard
* language compiler can identify weak and strong references, and something in between
* the speed of light is too slow, only 4 inches per clock cycle right now!
* build languages that understand how to handle references better to build better-distributed systems

## IPVM: Seamless Services for an Open World
_Brooklyn Zelenka_ [:video_camera:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5U8JQZXABs)

* What we have now was designed for the 90s
* the speed of light is too slow, limits responsivity, and increases latency

## An approach to computing and sustainability inspired from permaculture
_Devine Lu Linvega_

* The advantages of simple tools
* that which cannot be repaired is already broken
* a spaceship is limited by fuel, water, and food if humans are on it
* I live in a boat; it's basically a spaceship because it has limited capacity for power and water and food
* it's crazy to expect people to be online and on the fastest computer all of the time
* much of the history of computation is forgotten
* they didn't die because they were bad; they died because of natural selection

## Can a Programming Language Reason About Systems?
_Marianne Bellotti_
