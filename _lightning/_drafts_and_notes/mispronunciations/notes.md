# Mispronunciation Notes

> [I wanted to do a whole talk, probably a lightning talk but maybe a whole full length talk, in which I mispronounce as many technologies as possible and then render a lesson about why people shouldn't freak out about people's mispronunciations](https://twitter.com/colindean/status/1166122212367245312) - Colin Dean

## Common Mispronounced Words

* Kubernetes: Cube bear nets, Koo ber nets, Que bear net ees
* Scala: Scal ah
* Java: Dza vah
* nginx: en-jinx, ng-inks (Vietnamese `ng`)
* Linux: Lynn-icks, Line-uhcks, Lee-nooks
* Python: Py-THON (US), PY-thin (UK and the canonical naming reference of Monty Python, which used the latter)
* LaTeX:
    > _[Quanta](https://www.quantamagazine.org/computing-expert-says-programmers-need-more-math-20220517/)_: One last thing, about another side project of yours with a sizable impact: LaTeX. I’d like to finally clear something up with the creator. Is it pronounced LAH-tekh or LAY-tekh?
    >
    > _Leslie Lamport_: Any way you want. I don’t advise spending very much time thinking about it.

## Missteps

> nginx is pronounced engine-x. engine-x is a cool name. n-jinx is not. if i ever hear you pronounce it n-jinx, i will lose respect for you forever

* Long reply threads from [Bryan Cantrill](https://twitter.com/bcantrill/status/1536394205622243328)'s tweet about learning a word wrong

## Outcome

Do they know what you mean, without ambiguity?

Yes? Great.

No? Shift pronunciation.
