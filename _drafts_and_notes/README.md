# Drafts and speculative submissions

This directory contains presentations, notes, and half-baked ideas that could one day become something.
I have submitted some ideas in here speculatively.
That is, I've pitched them without having built the whole presentation.
This is normal and completely acceptable!

Not everything in here is good.
Not everything in here will eventually be presented.
Some things in here are crap.
Some things in here may be diamonds in the rough.
Not everything in here should be taken seriously.
Nothing in here should be taken as unmitigable fact.

If you see something in here that you want to see turn into a presentable form,
let me know in an [issue](https://github.com/colindean/talks/issues)!
