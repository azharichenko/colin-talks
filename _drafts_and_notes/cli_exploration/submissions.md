### Description/Abstract

A great command line tool is great not only because of what it accomplishes, but also how it is invoked. Deciding how to choose words that comprise argument switches, flags, and markers is form of art but deciding on what tools to use shouldn't be. In this talk, we'll tour a handful of frameworks for building command line experiences across a variety of languages. I'll evaluate how each expresses its options in the domain and see if there's a particular way that seems difficult but ultimately produces the most usable tool.
