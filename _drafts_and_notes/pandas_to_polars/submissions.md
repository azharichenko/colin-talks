### Title

Migrating from pandas to Polars, why and how

### Description

During a major data analysis project for our small tech community-focused organization, we encountered some growing pains while using pandas. pandas is a Python library for manipulating data so common that it's the default tool used in industry and taught in data science programs in higher-ed programs worldwide. We heard about Polars, a new implementation of the DataFrame architecture popularized by Apache Spark and pandas. Polars, written in Rust but offering a first-class experience for Python, expedited our development and enabled us to write clearer, faster data manipulation and analysis code. This presentation will provide a high-level introduction to these two frameworks, discuss their strengths and weaknesses, and then ultimately demonstrate our proven patterns for migration to Polars from pandas followed by how we designed our Polars analysis pipeline.
